This Major Qualifying Project would not have been possible without the contributions of many individuals in both the WPI community and at DraftKings. Firstly, to our WPI advisors Professor Randy Paffenroth and Professor Rick Brown, we thank you for your constant guidance, wisdom and direction from the start of this project to its end. Thank you to DraftKings and WPI for coordinating this project sponsorship and beginning what will hopefully be a productive cooperative. We particularly want to thank Brandon Ward at DraftKings for his major role in the development of our project. His advisory role throughout the course of our work was invaluable. In addition to these major players, many individuals played helpful auxiliary roles. Graduate student Rasika Karkare greatly aided our understanding of imbalanced data and provided strategies for us to work with it. Another graduate student, Wenjing Li, had experience in ensemble learning that was crucial to the development of our methodology. Finally, we thank WPI's Turing computer and particularly Spencer Pruitt for his regular assistance in getting our code running efficiently. To all these people and the many more who supported us through this process, we thank you. This project was made possible by you. \newline
