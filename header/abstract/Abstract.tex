%This is just a sample abstract from one of the old MQPs Rnayd advised

% In this Major Qualifying Project, we present a novel anomaly detection system for computer networks and a visualization system to help users explore network captures. The detection algorithm uses Robust Principal Component Analysis to produce a lower dimensional subspace of the original data for which a sparse matrix of outliers occurs. This low dimensional data subspace is determined by a novel contribution of this MQP to the standard practice of
% robust principal component analysis revolving around the relaxation parameter . These outliers from the low dimensional subspace can be thought of as features. Based on these features,
% firewall logs are classified as anomalous through a Random Forest classification trained on one type of anomaly. One of our key contributions is understanding the relationship between  and
% the underlying random forest detection algorithm. This detection system produces anomaly predictions which are visualized in this MQP. The visualization system has been designed to help cyber security analysts sort anomalies by attribute and view them in the context of normal network activity. The system consists of an overview of firewall logs, a detail view of each log, and a feature view where an analyst can see which features of the firewall log were implicated in the anomaly detection algorithm. The ability of each view to influence its sub-view allows users to sort through the traffic based on firewall attribute and refine their search down to individual
% anomalies.
