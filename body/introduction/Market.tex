\section{Why the Problem Matters}

As of 2017, there were nearly 60 million fantasy sport users in the united states alone and with each spending on average 556 dollars, the industry as a whole was then worth 7 billion dollars. DraftKings is a Boston based fantasy sport contest provider. Founded in 2012, they are a relatively new company, but they (along side their main competitor FanDuel) already control the vast majority of the growing fantasy sport market Together in 2017, they brought in 3/7 of the total fantasy sport revenue for that year with DraftKings earning a little more than half of that.

DraftKings runs daily fantasy sport competitions on virtually every major sport including but not limited to football, soccer, baseball, and even recently the e-sport League of Legends
